# Spatialization
# Use 'move' to animate sound sources in 3D space.
# Format: move = [type], xRange, yRange, zRange, speed
# - pos: static position (no movement)
# - walk: moves only along X and Z axes (Y is ignored)
# - fly: moves in full 3D space (X, Y, Z)
# The last value is always the speed (units per second)
# 'visualize = true' adds a Trail Renderer to show movement over time
