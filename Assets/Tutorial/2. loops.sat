# Loops
# loops are useful for continuous or ambient sounds that should stay active in the background

loop "ambience/forest":
    volume = 0.1        # subtle, steady presence
    fade_in = 5

loop "ambience/water":
    volume = 0.08        # quieter, more subtle
    pitch = 0.8to1.2    # pitch varies slightly on each loop, adding natural variation
    fade_in = 10

# prefix with a number to create multiple layers
3 * loop "ambience/forest":
    volume = 0.05
